# Exercode
Teach programming by doing. A compilation of programming exercises that students can fork, and ask feedback on their solution with pull requests.

## How to use

There is one file per exercise: *exercise_1.py* has Exercise 1, *exercise_2.py* has Exercise 2, etc.

This is the itended workflow:

1. You fork this repo.
2. You choose an exercise to work on (one exercise at a time). The instructions are in the comments at the top of the file. For example, this would be the instructions for a Hello World exercise:

        # HELLO WORLD
        #
        # Define a function "print_welcome" that prints "Hello World!" in the console when called.
        # "print_welcome" should not take any argument.
        #
    
3. You work on a solution. When you're done, you should put your answer in the file, below the line that says:
        
        # --- INSERT YOUR SOLUTION BELOW ---

4. Commit and push your solution on GitHub.
5. Open a pull request.
6. I comment and review your solution. If it's good enough, I accept the solution and merge it.
7. Back to 2.: you tackle another exercise.
